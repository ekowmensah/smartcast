- Supports Visa, Mastercard, and other cards
- Handles callbacks and verification

### 2. Backend - PaymentService.php âœ…
**File:** `src/Services/PaymentService.php`

Added `initializeCardPayment()` method:
- Creates payment transaction record with `payment_method: 'card'`
- Routes to Hubtel gateway
- Returns payment URL for redirect
- Handles success/failure responses

### 3. Backend - VoteController.php âœ…
**File:** `src/Controllers/VoteController.php`

Updated `processVote()` method:
- Accepts `payment_method` parameter (mobile_money or card)
- Routes to appropriate payment initialization method
- Handles both mobile money and card payment flows
- Sets up proper callback URLs

### 4. Frontend - vote-form.php âœ…
**File:** `views/voting/vote-form.php`

Added payment method selector UI:
- Beautiful card-based selection interface
- Mobile Money option (MTN, Telecel, AirtelTigo)
- Card Payment option (Visa, Mastercard)
- Visual feedback on selection

Added JavaScript functionality:
- Toggle phone number field based on payment method
- Update validation rules dynamically

- Handle mobile money direct charge

## Payment Flows

### Mobile Money Flow (Unchanged):
```
1. User selects Mobile Money
2. Enters phone number
3. Clicks Pay button
4. Payment initiated with Hubtel Direct Receive Money API
5. User receives USSD prompt (*170#)
6. User enters PIN to approve
7. Webhook processes vote
8. Success shown on page
```

### Card Payment Flow (NEW):
```
1. User selects Card Payment
2. Clicks Pay button (no phone number needed)
3. Redirected to Hubtel secure checkout page
4. User enters card details on Hubtel's page
5. Card processed by Hubtel
6. User redirected back to SmartCast callback URL
7. Webhook processes vote
8. Success shown on page
```

## User Interface

### Payment Method Selector:
- **Mobile Money Card**: Blue border, mobile icon, shows networks
- **Card Payment Card**: Gray border initially, credit card icon
- **Interactive**: Clicking highlights selected method
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop

### Phone Number Field:
- **Mobile Money**: Required, visible
- **Card Payment**: Hidden, not required

### Submit Button:
- **Mobile Money**: Requires phone number validation
- **Card Payment**: No phone validation needed

## Technical Details

### Database:
- Uses existing `payment_transactions` table
- `payment_method` field stores 'mobile_money' or 'card'
- `gateway_reference` stores transaction reference
- `related_id` links to voting transaction

### API Endpoints:
- **Initialization**: POST `/events/{slug}/vote/process`
  - Parameter: `payment_method` (mobile_money|card)
- **Callback**: GET/POST `/api/payment/callback/{transaction_id}`
  - Handles both mobile money and card callbacks
- **Status Check**: GET `/api/payment/status/{transaction_id}`
  - Works for both payment methods

### Security:
- âœ… Card details never touch your server (PCI DSS compliant)
- âœ… Hubtel handles all card processing
- âœ… Webhook signature verification
- âœ… HTTPS required for production

## Configuration Required

### 1. Hubtel Account Setup:
- Ensure Checkout API is enabled on your Hubtel account
- Same credentials work for both mobile money and card payments
- No additional configuration needed

### 2. Webhook URL:
- Already configured: `{APP_URL}/api/payment/callback/{transaction_id}`
- Must be registered in Hubtel dashboard
- Must be HTTPS in production

### 3. Testing:
Use Hubtel test cards:
- **Card Number**: 4111 1111 1111 1111
- **CVV**: Any 3 digits
- **Expiry**: Any future date
- **Name**: Any name

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `src/Services/Gateways/HubtelGateway.php` - Added card payment method
2. âœ… `src/Services/PaymentService.php` - Added card payment initialization
3. âœ… `src/Controllers/VoteController.php` - Added payment method routing
4. âœ… `views/voting/vote-form.php` - Added UI and JavaScript
