echo "=== TESTING WIZARD DRAFT NOMINEE IMAGE FIX ===\n\n";

echo "🎯 ISSUE IDENTIFIED:\n";
echo "   When editing draft events in wizard:\n";
echo "   ❌ OLD: All contestants deleted and recreated\n";
echo "   ❌ OLD: Existing images lost if no new upload\n";
echo "   ❌ OLD: Contestant codes regenerated\n\n";

echo "✅ FIX IMPLEMENTED:\n";
echo "   ✅ NEW: Update existing contestants instead of deleting\n";
echo "   ✅ NEW: Preserve existing images when no new upload\n";
echo "   ✅ NEW: Preserve contestant codes\n";
echo "   ✅ NEW: Only delete contestants removed from form\n\n";

echo "🔧 HOW THE FIX WORKS:\n\n";

echo "1. WHEN EDITING DRAFT EVENT:\n";
echo "   • Load existing contestants from database\n";
echo "   • Map them by their position/index\n\n";

echo "2. FOR EACH NOMINEE IN FORM:\n";
echo "   • Check if contestant already exists\n";
echo "   • If new file uploaded → use new image\n";
echo "   • If no new file → preserve existing image\n";
echo "   • Update existing OR create new contestant\n\n";

echo "3. CLEANUP:\n";
echo "   • Delete contestants removed from form\n";
echo "   • Preserve contestants still in form\n\n";

echo "📋 TESTING SCENARIO:\n";
echo "   1. Create draft event with Nominee 1 (with image)\n";
echo "   2. Save draft\n";
echo "   3. Edit draft, add Nominee 2 (with image)\n";
echo "   4. Save draft again\n";
echo "   5. ✅ RESULT: Both nominees should keep their images\n\n";

echo "🎯 EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:\n";
echo "   • Nominee 1 image URL: PRESERVED ✅\n";
echo "   • Nominee 2 image URL: NEW IMAGE ✅\n";
echo "   • Contestant codes: PRESERVED ✅\n";
echo "   • Database consistency: MAINTAINED ✅\n\n";

echo "⚠️  IMPORTANT NOTES:\n";
echo "   • This fix only applies to DRAFT events\n";
echo "   • Published events should use different update logic\n";
echo "   • File uploads still validated (size, type)\n";
echo "   • Category assignments properly handled\n\n";

echo "🧪 MANUAL TESTING STEPS:\n";
echo "   1. Go to event creation wizard\n";
echo "   2. Create event with 1 nominee + image\n";
echo "   3. Save as draft\n";
echo "   4. Edit draft event\n";
echo "   5. Add second nominee + image\n";
echo "   6. Save draft again\n";
echo "   7. Check database - both images should be preserved\n\n";

echo "=== END TEST ===\n";
